### Hi, I am Hande ðŸ‘‹

<p align="left">
I'm a statistician, data scientist and bioinformatician with over a decade of research experience. I'm a continuous learner and I strive to keep up to date with modern technologies in data science. So, here is my playground where I play with different tools by doing some small personal projects.

If you are interested in my other academic, work-related projects which are available elsewhere, you could have a look at <a href="https://github.com/PROBIC/GPrank/tree/master">here</a> for GPrank, which is an R package that can be useful for ranking short time series with uncertain measurements, or <a href="https://github.com/handetopa/hipsci-xci">here</a> for the results of our latest article where we delved deep into the complexities of X chromosome inactivation in human induced pluripotent stem cells.

Currently, I'm also attending Hive Helsinki to expand my skills further in programming, which is quite refreshing! :)
